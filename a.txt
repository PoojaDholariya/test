When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set upstream.

Make your changes locally and then add, commit, and push your changes to the <feature> branch: $ git add . Click the Source page of your repository. You should see both the master and the <feature> branch in the branches dropdown
